## Work-Day Scheduler
# Challenge #5 - Week 5:


# Project Description
### What is this project?
This weeks project is developing existing code, and adding functionality to the script.js file. My main goal for this project, is to create an app that would run in the browser and present a dynamically updated HTML and CSS app that is powered by JQuery. Taking advantage of libraries such as the Day.js library, I am to create a daily planner, enabling its user to manage their time effectively. The app is able to identify between past, present and future, and updates the time-block background-colour accordingly. The scheduler updates live, depending on the time of day between 9am through to 5pm. To the right of each time-block contains a save button, so if the user was to delete or reload the browser, their input would be saved locally. Additionally this project displays the current day, month and year on the top of the screen. 

### Files modified
For this project I heavily worked on the script.js file. However in some instances I had to modify and add addtional code to the style.css and index.html files.

### Challenges
When I reviewed the challenge I initially tackled it relatively well. I wrote comments and drafted major areas that I would later refine as the days go by. However, a challenge that I came across was setting and extracting items from the local storage using JQuery. I aimed to use minimal lines of code to tackle tasks, however, could not come up with an effective method for saving buttons. Rather than having all the buttons under a singe class name, I gave each button and its corresponding text-area a unique name. This is an issue that I will need to perfect for later projects.
